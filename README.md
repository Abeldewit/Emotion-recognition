## Computer Vision
### _Assignment 2_
In this project an exploration of the possible architectures and parameters of a Convolutional Neural Network is performed using the [Facial Expression Recognition dataset (FER Challenge)](https://www.kaggle.com/ashishpatel26/facial-expression-recognitionferchallenge/metadata) dataset. 

The assignment is part of the Computer Vision course of the Msc. Artificial Intelligence at Maastricht University. 

**Tasks**:
* Build a CNN model using different architectures
* Tune different parameters such as activation-, and optimization function, loss function, and learning rate.
* Evaluate the model using accuracy, precision, and recall using both quantitative and qualitative measures.
* Visualize the learnt filters on different layers. Display relevant activations for different emotions.
* Write a report on the findings
